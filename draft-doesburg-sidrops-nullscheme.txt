Abstract

   This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The Null Scheme is a
   toy signature scheme that can replace the redundant and costly use of
   actual digital signatures from so-called "one-time-use" key pairs in
   Signed Objects.  The Null Scheme has as public key the digest of the
   message to be signed, and the signature is always empty.  When a Null
   Scheme public key is the subject of a Signed Object's one-time-use
   End-Entity (EE) certificate, it establishes a secure binding between
   the issuer of the EE certificate and the message to be signed.  This
   is cheaper in terms of size and verification time than using a real
   signature scheme, while providing the same security guarantees.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].  The Null
   Scheme is a toy signature scheme that can replace the redundant and
   costly use of actual digital signatures from so-called "one-time-use"
   key pairs in RPKI Signed Objects [RFC6488].

   Signed Objects contain an End-Entity (EE) certificate issued by a
   Certificate Authority (CA).  This EE certificate usually contains a
   public key corresponding to a one-time-use key pair, which is used to
   sign a single CMS signed-data object [RFC5652].  The practice of
   using each key pair for only one Signed Object enables the use of a
   CRL [RFC5280] to revoke individual objects.  However, it means that
   each Signed Object consists of two signatures and a public key,
   whereas, intuitively, only one signature should be needed to bind the
   object to its issuer.

   The Null Scheme is _not_ an actual digital signature algorithm, or
   even a One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme: it requires the (single)
   message to be signed to be known before the public key can be
   generated.

   Essentially, the Null Scheme works as follows:

   *  the public key is the digest of the single message to be signed,

   *  there is no private key, and

   *  the signature is always empty.

   Signature generation has to happen together with generation of the
   public key, taking the message to be signed as input.  A public key
   cannot be generated without the message being known in advance.
   Verification is done by simply comparing the message digest with the
   public key.

   As the input to a signing algorithm when signing a CMS signed-data
   object is the output of the Message Digest Calculation Process
   defined in Section 5.4 of [RFC5652], the Null Scheme's public key is
   technically directly the input of the signing algorithm, rather than
   a digest of that input.  This avoids an unnecessary extra hashing
   step.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Related Work

   The Null Scheme is inspired by the idea that the one-time-use key
   pairs in RPKI Signed Objects could be replaced using One-Time
   Signature (OTS) algorithms, such as hash-based Lamport or Winternitz
   signatures as used in XMSS [RFC8391] and LMS [RFC8554].  While this
   could be a suitable post-quantum alternative to current signature
   schemes, these hash-based OTS algorithms have large signatures.  It
   was then observed that the requirements for the one-time-use key
   pairs in Signed Objects are even weaker than those offered by OTS
   algorithms: it is possible to know the message to be signed before
   generating the key pair.

   The Null Scheme takes advantage of this to achieve optimal size and
   verification time while preserving the structure and validation
   process of Signed Objects.  This makes it possible to introduce the
   Null Scheme in the RPKI without requiring any changes to its
   specifications such as [RFC6480] and [RFC6488]: only the algorithms
   specification [RFC7935] needs to be updated.

1.2.1.  Attribute Certificates

   Several other toy signature schemes exist that have some similarities
   to the Null Scheme, but serve a different purpose.  [RFC5755]
   describes the use of 'Attribute Certificates' that can allow
   something other than a public key to be the subject of an X509
   certificate.  Through using the 'ObjectDigestInfo' holder type (see
   Section 7.3 of [RFC5755]) something equivalent to the Null Scheme can
   be achieved: the 'holder' of an Attribute Certificate is the digest
   of an RPKI Signed Object's payload.  However, compared to the Null
   Scheme, using Attribute Certificates in place of plain X.509 EE
   certificates would require much more extensive changes to the RPKI
   specifications, making it operationally less practical to introduce.

1.2.2.  No-Signature

   Appendix C.1 of [RFC5272] and [I-D.ietf-lamps-x509-alg-none-00]
   define a No-Signature algorithm for signatures in X.509 certificates
   and CMS signed-data objects.  These specifications are intended for
   use-cases where a signature is not needed at all.  However, in RPKI
   Signed Objects, _something_ is needed to bind the Signed Object to an
   EE certificate.  This can be achieved by removing the signature from
   the CMS signed-data (as in the No-Signature scheme) only if the
   signed-data is linked to the EE certificate in some other way.  That
   binding is provided by the Null Scheme through the EE certificate's
   public key.  Many alternative ways to provide such a binding exist
   (such as using Attribute Certificates as mentioned above), but
   require more extensive changes to the structure of Signed Objects.

1.2.3.  Relying on digest in Manifests

   Another more radical way of reducing the cryptographic overhead in
   the RPKI is to remove the CMS signed-data wrapper and EE certificate
   from Signed Objects (other than Manifests [RFC6486]) entirely, and
   instead rely on the digest of the Signed Object being listed in a
   valid Manifest.  This is a major change to the workings of the RPKI.
   It would reduce the cryptographic overhead much more (removing a
   public key and not one but two signatures per object), but would be
   very hard to introduce in practice.

2.  Definition

   The Null Scheme MUST only be used to sign and verify the CMS signed-
   data object contained in an RPKI Signed Object [RFC6488].
   Consequently, when it is used, a Null Scheme public key appears as
   the subject of a one-time-use EE certificate attached in the
   certificates field of the Signed Object's CMS signed-data object.
   The Null Scheme signature appears in the single SignerInfo object
   included in the signed-data object's signerInfos field.

   As the Null Scheme requires the message to be signed to be known
   before the public key can be generated, it consists of two
   algorithms: SignOnce and Verify, rather than the usual KeyGen, Sign,
   and Verify algorithms.

2.1.  Public Key and Signature Generation

   The SignOnce algorithm takes as input the message to be signed m.  It
   produces as output a public key pk and a signature sig.  As the Null
   Scheme must only be used to sign CMS signed-data objects, the input
   message m is the output of the Message Digest Calculation Process
   defined in Section 5.4 of [RFC5652].  Therefore, although the Null
   Scheme's public key is always a digest of the message, the SignOnce
   algorithm actually returns its input m directly.  The digest
   algorithm used is indicated by the SignerInfo object's
   digestAlgorithm field.

     1. pk = m    # The output of the message digest calculation process
     2. sig = ""  # Empty octet string
     3. return (pk, sig)

                      Figure 1: Algorithm SignOnce(m)

2.2.  Signature Verification

   The Verify algorithm takes as input a message m, a public key pk, and
   a signature sig.  Like SignOnce, the input m is the output of the
   Message Digest Calculation Process defined in Section 5.4 of
   [RFC5652].  It produces as output either "valid" or "invalid".

     1. if sig == "" and pk == m then return "valid"
     2. return "invalid"

                   Figure 2: Algorithm Verify(m, pk, sig)

       PUBLIC-KEYS {pk-RPKI-NULL-SCHEME}
     }

   END

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Security Reduction to Second-Preimage Resistance

   Although the Null Scheme cannot be used as a general-purpose digital
   signature algorithm, it does provably provide the same security
   properties that are expected from normal digital signatures.

   Given a public key pk and corresponding message-signature pair (m,
   sig), finding another valid message-signature pair (m', sig') is
   clearly impossible: a pair (m', sig') is only valid under public key
   pk if m' == pk and sig' == "", and therefore m' == m.

   As the Null Scheme is used to sign CMS signed-data objects, it is, as
   with any other signature scheme, possible for two distinct messages
   to lead to the same message digest.  Finding such a second message m'
   given a message m that is valid under public key pk is breaking the
   second-preimage resistance of H.  This would not only allow forging
   (or reusing) a Null Scheme signature on m', but also reusing the
   signature of any other signature scheme.  This makes the Null Scheme
   strictly no less secure than any other signature scheme paired with
   the same digest algorithm H.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value from the "SMI Security for S/
   MIME Module Identifier" registry [RFC7299] for the ASN.1 module
   RPKINullScheme2025 defined in this document, and a value for id-RPKI-
   NULL-SCHEME-SHA256 from the "SMI Security for PKIX Algorithms"
   registry [RFC7299].

   Editorial note: the assigned OID values will need to be added in the
   ASN.1 module, and test vectors regenerated using the definitive value
   for id-RPKI-NULL-SCHEME-SHA256.

Appendix A.  Test Vectors

   The following test vector is a base-64 encoded RPKI Signed Object
   containing an EE certificate with as subject a Null Scheme public key
   matching the signed content.  The EE certificate is issued by an RSA
   key pair, whose public key is also added below.

   Editorial note: the test vectors below are generated using
   placeholder OID value 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.6.37 for id-RPKI-NULL-SCHEME-
   SHA256.  This is currently the first unallocated value in the "SMI
   Security for PKIX Algorithms" registry, so could plausibly be the
   final value assigned by IANA.  If it is not, the test vectors will
   need to be updated accordingly.
