Null Scheme for Signed Objects in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure

Abstract

   This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The Null Scheme is a
   toy signature scheme that can replace the redundant and costly use of
   actual digital signatures from so-called "one-time-use" key pairs in
   Signed Objects.  The Null Scheme has as public key the digest of the
   message to be signed, and the signature is always empty.  When a Null
   Scheme public key is the subject of a Signed Object's one-time-use
   End-Entity (EE) certificate, it establishes a secure binding between
   the issuer of the EE certificate and the message to be signed.  This
   is cheaper in terms of size and verification time than using a real
   signature scheme, while providing the same security guarantees.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].  The Null
   Scheme is a toy signature scheme that can replace the redundant and
   costly use of actual digital signatures from so-called "one-time-use"
   key pairs in RPKI Signed Objects [RFC6488].  Signed Objects contain
   an End-Entity (EE) certificate issued by a Certificate Authority
   (CA).  This EE certificate usually contains a public key
   corresponding to a one-time-use key pair, which is used to sign a
   single CMS signed-data object.  The practice of using each key pair
   for only one Signed Object enables the use of a CRL [RFC5280] to
   revoke individual objects.

   The null scheme is _not_ an actual digital signature algorithm, or
   even a One-Time Signature (OTS) scheme: it requires the (single)
   message to be signed to be known before the public key can be
   generated.
